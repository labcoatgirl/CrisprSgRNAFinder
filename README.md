### CRISPR-Cas9 Finder Project

INFO: A Perl program to find sgRNA sequences from Fasta or Bed format files.

##### sgRNA
The sgRNAs are 20 nt sequence used for CRISPR-Cas9 system. 
a PAM sequence (NGG for Cas9) should be followed immedaitely after the sgRNA.

##### Strategy 
The searching for N20-NGG sequence is simple and straightforward. However evaluating the potential off-target effcts and the on-targeting activity is yet chanllenging.
